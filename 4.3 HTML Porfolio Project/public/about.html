<p>
  My name is Wang, Zhijie, I am currently working for Vector Informatike in
  Shanghai as an IT Expert. My primary responsibilities involve managing
  PREEvision and Server API projects. I lead various projects, including
  Polarion, Feishu, and web development initiatives that implement the
  PREEvision API. Additionally, I assist my team with server automation scripts
  using AWX and have built a local AI model to query product materials. I also
  designed and led the creation of an animation video for the PREEvision API to
  promote API sales, successfully securing cases with Hongqi, FAW Jiefang, and
  Li Auto. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated commendable dedication and
  commitment. My work on IT premium support has showcased my exceptional
  attention to detail and problem-solving skills, consistently meeting deadlines
  and delivering high-quality results. I maintain a positive attitude, even in
  challenging situations, and have successfully led the completion of
  collaboration platform installation projects, receiving high praise from
  customers. My contributions to the Server API project web development are
  significant, including the successful completion of the third-phase
  development of our website. During the VC Technology Day, we showcased our
  website developed based on the PREEvision API to a broad audience, earning
  recognition and a bonus for my achievements at the Symposium. In my previous
  role as a Senior Accountant at Ernst & Young from October 2021 to March 2022,
  I was responsible for the Enterprise Financial Integrity System (EFIS) data
  visualization and visual database development. I worked closely with algorithm
  groups and used Power BI to design a database visualization model based on a
  risk assessment model. My responsibilities included database testing,
  development, and server operations, where I built and deployed
  PostgreSQL/MySQL databases and managed server operations. Prior to that, I
  worked as a Database Software Development Engineer at YaoJu Information Inc
  (RSIC) from March 2021 to October 2021. I designed and developed a database
  back-end management system and server database and management system
  functional modules. My role included applying Docker/Kubernetes into the SDLC,
  deploying local services to Kirin cloud, and using PostgreSQL for data
  management. As a IT Analyst for Computer Aid Inc (Zoetis Contractor) from
  April 2019 to December 2020, I provided IT support through various platforms
  and applied my analytical skills to identify and resolve software issues. In
  addition to my professional achievements, I lead an active lifestyle, serving
  as the VC badminton team captain and engaging in basketball and fitness
  activities. These hobbies allow me to foster connections with colleagues and
  build friendships across departments. My educational background includes a
  Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Technology from The Pennsylvania
  State University, with a minor in Business. I am proficient in a variety of
  programming languages and tools, including Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  and Docker. I also hold an AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification.
